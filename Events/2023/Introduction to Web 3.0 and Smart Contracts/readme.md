Web 3.0 is the next evolution of the internet, where data is decentralized and controlled by users,<br>and blockchain technology is a critical component of this decentralized ecosystem. <br>Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly <br>written into lines of code. These contracts are stored on a blockchain network, <br>enabling secure and transparent execution without the need for intermediaries. By utilizing smart contracts,<br>Web 3.0 aims to create a more efficient and trustless system for transactions and interactions between users, <br>creating new opportunities for decentralized applications and disrupting traditional industries.<br>
