The ECO-CRYPT Cipher Project '23 celebrated Environment Day with a cybersecurity twist. Participants explored open-source tools, mastered GitHub, and unraveled the secrets of ciphers. They encrypted ASCII characters into captivating emojis and shared them securely via WhatsApp. The event highlighted the intersection of nature and cybersecurity.


## 2. [Malware Analysis Project](https://csyclub-iiitk.gitbook.io/map) [Ongoing]

The Cyber Security Club is conducting an ongoing malware analysis project, focusing on identifying and dissecting various types of malware. This project involves reverse engineering malware samples to understand their behavior, origin, and impact. By analyzing code patterns and attack vectors, the team aims to develop effective countermeasures and enhance overall cybersecurity defenses. This initiative not only contributes to the club's research efforts but also provides valuable hands-on experience for members in advanced cybersecurity techniques.



## 3. [CTF Guide](https://csyclub-iiitk.gitbook.io/ctf-guide) [Ongoing]

The Cyber Security Club is developing a comprehensive Capture The Flag (CTF) guide. This guide will include detailed explanations of common CTF challenges, strategies for solving them, and practical tips for effective participation. Covering categories such as web exploitation, cryptography, binary exploitation, and reverse engineering, the guide aims to equip members with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in CTF competitions. This resource will serve as both an educational tool and a reference for aspiring cybersecurity professionals.
